## **Project Priorities and degrees of freedom:**
The main priority is to finish the project before the expiration date. The project is very elastic this means that was given a lot freedom within the objective to follow. 

-------
## **Approach:**
 An iterative and incremental approach is planned. The highest priority features will be implemented first such that after the first iteration there will always be a usable product. Speculative architecture and design will be kept to a minimum. 


-------
## **Constraints:**
The final solution is restricted by the software and service that we had to use: MoodleCloud.


-------
## **Assumptions:** 
We assume that once the project will be released it will be used by the majority of the ITI Marconi.


-------
## **Success Criteria:** 
The project will be considered a success if the team delivers an operational prototype at the end of the semester with the features mentioned in the goal section above.
The overall project will be deemed a success if the product success criteria is met by the scheduled project end date.


------
## **Scope:**
As mentioned in the goals section above, the delivered product should demonstrate the ability to deliver content tailored to the userâ€™s preferences.


------
## **Risks and obstacles to success:**
At the beginning of the project, the team had little knowledge about this online platform called "MoodleCloud".
