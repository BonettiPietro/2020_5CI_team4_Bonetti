# 1 Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide an online platoform to be used by teachers and students of ITI Marconi.

# 4 System Maintenance

## 4.1Old User maintenance

It&#39;s important for a correct use of the platform to ensure free space for new users, for this reason users who no longer use the platform will have to be removed periodically every school year.

## 4.2New User maintenance

Every beginning of the school year excel files must be collected with the information regarding new users inserted, they will subsequently be uploaded through an upload procedure directly on the platform.
