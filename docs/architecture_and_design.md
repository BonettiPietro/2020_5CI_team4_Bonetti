The service was not created by us but we made it available to the school adapting the platform with its tools to an educational use. Our service is a S.a.a.S

**1.1 Architecture S.A.A.S**
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which the application and any related services are performed in a centralized environment and users access it via the network, almost always via the Internet and using a browser as an interface. It is the model that is typically indicated today with the expression "cloud services" and is the evolution of the ASP (Application Service Provider) model of the 1990s.

There are, however, substantial differences:

 * almost always in the SaaS model to provide the application and its services is the reality that developed it
 * the interface used is a browser
 * the architecture is multi-tenant, that is, there is only one   application that serves multiple users keeping their respective data and operating environments separate.

The SaaS model is considered the winning one by all the main software vendors, who have created "as a Service" versions of their main applications and supply them through a proprietary cloud infrastructure created ad hoc or by relying on other cloud service providers.
