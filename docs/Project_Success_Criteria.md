# __Success Criteria for SAAS Project__
## __The SAAS project will be considered a success if...__

### __A fully functional test service is delivered on or before May 25th, 2019__

The service shall be delivered in a state that is ready to be used in its intended production environment for its intended purpose. The users shall be given the training they need in order to begin using the system. We will consider both of these goals met if the users who plan to use the service during its test period fill out the attached Acceptance Test User Survey and:

- No one circles "No" on the first two questions.
- If anyone circles “Yes, with reservations” on the first two questions, these reservations shall be resolved prior to (Moth day) to the satisfaction of the users with the reservations

### __Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the problem resolution plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan__

All critical defects found before May 25th will be fixed. A critical defect is one for which there is no convenient workaround. Beyond fixing defects, requested changes will be handled on a sliding scale. Changes taking 30 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 3 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 20 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 2 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 10 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 1 week before the scheduled end of the project.
Users shall be notified of their rights and responsibilities under this policy prior to the start of acceptance test.

### __Community Youth can easily log into the system.__

This specifically means that a Youth will be able to select the login option, type their first and last name or some portion of their first and/or last name, select events and press a confirmation button.

### __SAAS supervisors can edit events in the system calendar.__

Specifically, a volunteer or officer will be able to login to the system, select the calendar option, and add or remove special events. Also, this means that they will be able to control the events available for daily youth login.

### __SAAS supervisors can create and edit user accounts.__

This includes officer, volunteer and youth accounts. All data should be editable from the Internet interface.

### __The production database is updated.__

Data from the SAAS's existing database is uploaded to the new system. Data from all fields in the existing database shall be migrated to corresponding fields in the new database.

### __SAAS supervisors can print all reports outlined in spreadsheet sample reports provided during 21/4 requirements meeting.__

These reports shall be in the form of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with the data properly displayed. The data on the report should accurately reflect that which is in the database.

### __Raw data on Youth, activities and volunteers is available for download__

Officers shall be able to download raw data on youth and their activities in order to produce ad hoc reports.

&nbsp;

### __The System is properly documented.__

First, a user manual shall be produced and included with the system. This user manual shall be easy to understand for non-technical users familiar with basic Internet and spreadsheet concepts. This manual shall explain only how to use all features of the system.

Second, a system manual shall be produced. This system manual shall consist of the architecture document, as well as any additional material required to provide a technician with all necessary information needed to maintain and update the system. A single read through of this document and no more than 2 hours looking at the code should provide an appropriately skilled technician with all the information necessary to understand the system and make simple changes such as add a field to a generated report.
