# 1 Overview

## 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this project is to provide an online platoform to be used by teachers and students of ITI Marconi. This platform will provide to teachers the instruments to create courses for their students to undertake them. The courses on this online platform will allow students to get a better learning of the subject.


## 1.2 Goals and Objectives

The general goal of the project is provide a software (as a service) that will provide a better learning experience for students and provide better teaching instruments for teachers.

- The service should be useful.
- The service should be convenient and easy to use. It should require no prior computer experience and be usable after a brief 1-minute introduction. Use of the service should not cause frustation or confusion.



## 1.3 Project Deliverables

This section lists the outputs of the project that are delivered to the customer.

The following items will be delivered to the customer on or before 25/05/2019

1. User's Guide
2. System Administrators Manual
3. Test Plan
4. System test Cases
5. Suite of regression tests
6. Data conversion program for migrating existing data to new database format.

## 1.4 Assumptions and Constraints

We assume that once the project will be released it will be used by the majority of the ITI Marconi.
The final solution is restricted by the software and service that we had to use: MoodleCloud.

## 1.5 Schedule and Budget Summary

The following milestones are planned. The dates are very rough estimates. Rough estimate for project duration is 6-18 months. The schedule below is based on a 12-month project life cycle.

- 30/03/2019 - Starting of the project.
- 04/04/2019 - Project Charter Approved.
- 10/04/2019 - Development of the course structure.
- 15/05/2019 - Implementation of the lessons.
- 21/04/2019 - Implementation of the mini-quizzes.
- 28/04/2019 - User Guide and System administration manual Complete.
- 25/05/2019 - Product released

The entire project was based on free services and software, so no budget was needed.


## 1.6 Success Criteria

The project will be considered a success if the team delivers an operational prototype at the end of the semester with the features mentioned in the goal section above. The overall project will be deemed a success if the product success criteria is met by the scheduled project end date.




## 1.8 Evolution of the Project Plan

Before the start of an iteration, the project plan will be updated to include a schedule of detailed tasks for the upcoming iteration. At the conclusion of an iteration, the project plan will be updated to include the actual effort for each completed task.

Risk mitigation efforts will be evaluated at the start of each iteration. Severe risks will be analyzed and added to the project plan as soon as they materialize.

# 2 Startup Plan

## 2.1 Team Organization

- Project Manager: Bonetti Pietro 

- Developer : Dpnatelli Diego, Picilli Cristiano, Rizzotti Giovanni, Zecchin Pietro. 

- Requirements Tester: 
    The project was tested and corrected initially by Professor Rossi Laura, following its approval we expanded the utility to the 4Ci class to verify correct functionality in the common reality.
## 2.2 Project Communications

The information for the use of the software (email, password, username) is initially collected through user management applications and or by e-mail, after which it is entered manually in the program's user database.


## 2.3 Tools

This section specifies the development tools the team will be using to perform their work.

- .Version Control – gitjub.
- .Build tools – we have used visual studio code for make the documentations.
- .specific program - excel for insert the new user.
- .specific program - moodle, is the online platform were we work (SAAS).

# 3 Work Plan

## 3.1 Activities 

Schedule Information (Major milestones and deliverables):
The following milestones are planned. The dates are very rough estimates. Rough estimate for project duration is 6-18 months. The schedule below is based on a 12-month project life cycle.

30/03/2019 - Starting of the project.

25/05/2019 - Product released

## 3.2 Release Plan

An iterative and incremental approach is planned. The highest priority features will be implemented first such that after the first iteration there will always be a usable product. Speculative architecture and design will be kept to a minimum.

## 3.3 Budget

The entire project was based on free services and software, so no budget was needed.

# 4 Control Plan


## 4.1 Project Measurements


the project was followed from the outset through the scrum methodology, daily meetings were held to ensure the quality and punctuality of the work, below you will find the main dates and movements that characterize our work

# 5 Supporting Process Plans

## 5.1 Risk Management Plan

At the beginning of the project, the team had little knowledge about this online platform called "MoodleCloud".
